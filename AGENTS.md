# AGENTS.md — AI Agent Documentation

This document describes the structure, style, and conventions of the taglib-ts
repository. It is intended for AI coding agents and contributors who need to
understand the codebase quickly.

## Repository Overview

**taglib-ts** is a pure TypeScript port of the C++ [TagLib](https://taglib.org/)
library. It reads and writes audio metadata (tags) for 21+ container formats in
any JavaScript runtime (browsers, Node.js, Deno, Bun) — no WASM or native code
required.

## Key Conventions

### File Naming
- Source files: `camelCase.ts` (e.g., `mpegFile.ts`, `byteVector.ts`)
- Test files: `camelCase.test.ts` (e.g., `fileRef.test.ts`)
- One class per file; filename matches the primary export

### Import Style
- Relative imports with `.js` extension: `import { Foo } from './foo.js'`
- Type-only imports where possible: `import type { Bar } from './bar.js'`
- Dynamic `import()` in `fileRef.ts` for code splitting

### Class Patterns
- **File classes** extend `File` (abstract base) — constructor takes
  `(stream: IOStream, readProperties?: boolean, readStyle?: ReadStyle)`
- **Tag classes** extend `Tag` — provide property getters/setters and
  `properties()` / `setProperties()` for PropertyMap access
- **Properties classes** extend `AudioProperties` — read-only audio info
- All stream I/O goes through the `IOStream` interface; the in-memory
  implementation is `ByteVectorStream`

### Binary Data
- Use `ByteVector` for binary buffers (not raw `Uint8Array`)
- Integer conversions: `.toUInt()`, `.toShort()`, `.toLongLong()` etc.
- String conversions: `.toString(StringType.Latin1)`, `.toString(StringType.UTF8)`
- Byte-by-byte access: `.get(i)`, `.mid(offset, length)`

### Format Detection
- Extension-based detection in `detectByExtension()`
- Content-based detection in `detectByContent()`
- Both live in `formatDetection.ts` with **no imports of format classes**
  to enable tree-shaking / code splitting
- MPEG detection is always last (frame sync bytes cause false positives)

### Testing
- Use `vitest` — `npm test` runs all tests
- Test helpers in `tests/testHelper.ts`:
  - `readTestData(filename)` → `Uint8Array`
  - `openTestStream(filename)` → `ByteVectorStream`
  - `readTestDataBV(filename)` → `ByteVector`
- Binary test data lives in `tests/data/`
- Name tests after the C++ test file they port (e.g., `test_fileref.cpp` → `fileRef.test.ts`)

### Testing Rules and C++ Compatibility

These rules are **mandatory** and must never be violated:

1. **Every C++ test has a TypeScript equivalent.** For every test method in
   `taglib/tests/test_*.cpp` there must be a corresponding `it(...)` block in
   the matching TypeScript test file.

2. **Asserted values must match C++ exactly.** If a C++ test asserts
   `CPPUNIT_ASSERT_EQUAL(1887, f.audioProperties()->lengthInSeconds())`, the
   TypeScript test must assert `expect(props.lengthInSeconds).toBe(1887)`.
   Do **not** relax, approximate, or omit expected values.

3. **Never change a test value to make a bad implementation pass.** If the
   TypeScript output disagrees with the C++ expectation, the implementation
   must be fixed.  Only change the test itself when the C++ source changed and
   you have verified the new C++ value.

4. **Byte equality is required for ALL writable formats.** Cross-validation
   tests in `cTagLibValidation.test.ts` MUST verify byte-for-byte identical
   output between taglib-ts and C++ TagLib for every format that taglib-ts can
   write.  Both implementations start from the **same original file**, so
   format-specific bytes (vendor strings, audio data, etc.) are preserved
   identically in both outputs.  The only bytes that differ are tag bytes, and
   those must match exactly.  If bytes differ, fix the TypeScript
   implementation — **never add `skipByteEquality: true` as a workaround**.

5. **Audio properties must match.** All audio-property fields
   (`lengthInSeconds`, `lengthInMilliseconds`, `bitrate`, `sampleRate`,
   `channels`, etc.) returned by a TypeScript `AudioProperties` subclass must
   equal the values returned by the corresponding C++ `AudioProperties`
   subclass for the same file.

6. **Cross-validation tests must compare audio properties between
   implementations.** When a format has audio properties (sample rate, channels,
   etc.), the cross-validation test must verify that the C++ validator reports
   the same audio property values for both the C-tagged and TS-tagged outputs.

7. **Tag collection ordering must be deterministic and match C++.** Any
   tag field collection (ID3v2 frames, XiphComment fields, APEv2 items, MP4
   items, ASF attributes) must be rendered in **alphabetical key order** to
   match C++ `TagLib::Map<K, V>` (which uses `std::map` sorted iteration).
   Insertion-order JavaScript `Map` iteration is NOT acceptable for rendering.

8. **All tests must pass at all times.** Every `it(...)` block in every test
   file must pass before changes are merged.  Running the full suite with
   `npx vitest run` must report zero failures (tests that require the C
   validators are automatically skipped when the validators are not built).
   Never disable or skip a test to hide a failure — fix the implementation.

9. **Format parity with C++ is mandatory.** Every audio container format that
   C++ TagLib supports must have a corresponding TypeScript implementation in
   taglib-ts:
   - **Read support:** If C++ can read a format, TypeScript must also be able
     to read it with the same data.
   - **Write support:** If C++ can write a format, TypeScript must also be able
     to write it.  A cross-validation test in `cTagLibValidation.test.ts` MUST
     exist for every writable format, verifying byte-for-byte identical output
     between the two implementations.
   - Adding a new format to taglib-ts automatically requires a cross-validation
     entry.  Adding a format as read-only (`tsReadOnly: true`) is only
     acceptable when write support has not yet been implemented; the format
     must eventually be made writable and byte-equal.

10. **Every ported `it(...)` block must cite its C++ source.** The first line
    inside each `it(...)` callback must be a comment of the form:
    ```ts
    // C++: test_<format>.cpp – <TestClassName>::<testMethodName>
    ```
    For example:
    ```ts
    it("testAudioProperties", async () => {
      // C++: test_flac.cpp – TestFLAC::testAudioProperties
      ...
    });
    ```
    This makes it trivial to cross-reference the TypeScript test with its C++
    counterpart and verify that asserted values are correct.  Tests that have
    no C++ counterpart (TypeScript-only tests) must instead begin with:
    ```ts
    // TypeScript-only test
    ```

11. **C validators must build and all cross-validation tests must pass.**
    The C validator programs (`validator/taglib_validate.cpp` and
    `validator/tag_with_c_full.cpp`) must compile without errors or warnings.
    **Any change to these files must be followed by a full build and test run**
    before committing — no exceptions:
    ```sh
    cmake -B validator/build -S validator
    cmake --build validator/build
    TAGLIB_VALIDATE=validator/build/taglib_validate \
    TAGLIB_TAGGER=validator/build/tag_with_c_full \
      npx vitest run src/tests/cTagLibValidation.test.ts
    ```
    Build against the TagLib submodule in CI (not the system library), so
    always verify that the headers and namespaces used match the submodule
    (currently v2.2.1).  All cross-validation tests in
    `cTagLibValidation.test.ts` must pass with the built validators, verifying
    byte-identical output between C++ TagLib and taglib-ts for every writable
    format.

### Adding a New Format

1. Create `src/<format>/` directory with at minimum:
   - `<format>File.ts` — extends `File`
   - `<format>Properties.ts` — extends `AudioProperties`
   - `<format>Tag.ts` — extends `Tag` (or reuse existing tag types)
2. Add extension mapping in `formatDetection.ts` → `detectByExtension()`
3. Add content detection in `formatDetection.ts` → `detectByContent()`
4. Add dynamic import case in `fileRef.ts` → `instantiateFormat()`
5. Add exports in `index.ts`
6. Add the extension(s) to `defaultFileExtensions()` in `formatDetection.ts`
7. Write tests in `tests/<format>.test.ts`
8. Add test data files to `tests/data/`

### Code Style
- ESLint with `@stylistic/eslint-plugin` for formatting
- Double quotes, semicolons, 2-space indentation
- Trailing commas in multiline
- `npm run lint` to check, `npm run format` to auto-fix

### CI
- GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/build.yml`
- Runs on Node 20 and 22
- Steps: install → type check → build → test

## API Layers

1. **Simple API** (`readTags` / `writeTags`) — fire-and-forget, returns plain
   objects, suitable for most use cases
2. **FileRef** — format-agnostic handle with `tag()`, `save()`,
   `properties()`, `complexProperties()` etc.
3. **Format-specific classes** — direct access to e.g. `MpegFile`, `FlacFile`,
   `Mp4Tag` for advanced use.

## TypeScript Configuration
- `target: ES2022`, `module: NodeNext`
- Strict mode enabled
- Output to `dist/`

## Documentation
- The npm package name is `@dantheman827/taglib-ts`
- All TypeScript files must have an `@packageDocumentation` comment describing the purpose of the file.
- All classes, methods, properties, and variables must have JSDoc tags regardless of if they're public or not.
- Examples must always be accurate to the current state of the code.
- The AGENTS.md must remain current as changes are made to the project structure.

## Documentation and Examples

Maintaining accurate documentation and working examples is mandatory. These rules ensure the repository remains usable and examples reflect the current public API and behavior.

1. **Mandatory verification on source changes:** Whenever changes are made to source files that affect public APIs, behavior, or examples, contributors MUST verify that:
    - All examples under the `examples/` directory still build and run as intended.
    - Any inline code examples in `README.md` continue to be correct and runnable.

2. **Update or add tests for examples:** If an example no longer functions due to intentional API changes, update the example to the new API and, add or update tests that exercise the example's main usage path.

3. **README.md accuracy rule:** Agents and contributors MUST ensure `README.md` is kept accurate. Before merging changes that affect the public surface or examples, an agent or reviewer must:
    - Run the examples in `examples/` and any runnable snippets from `README.md` (manually or via automated scripts).
    - Update `README.md` to reflect API, usage, or configuration changes.
    - If the README contains non-runnable conceptual examples, add a short note indicating they are illustrative and provide a linking runnable example in `examples/`.

4. **Commit message and PR checklist entries:** Pull requests that change source files should include a checklist item confirming that examples and README snippets were verified and updated as necessary.

5. **CI / Automation (recommended):** Where practical, add CI checks that run the `examples/` directory scripts and validate runnable README snippets to catch regressions early.

6.  **typedoc warnings:** Agents and contributors MUST ensure that typedoc warnings are resolved for accurate documentation.
    - If a symbol is referenced by another but not included in the documentation, that symbol must be exported as public.  Use the `@internal` block tag to mark this as internal.
    - If a symbol is referenced by another but cannot be resolved, the type should be imported in the referencing file.
      - If a type is imported to satisfy typedoc, but it creates an eslint warning, add an internal type to satisfy the usage requirement, for example: 
        ```ts
        type _IOStream = IOStream; // Used for type imports to prevent eslint warnings.`
        ```
      - If a type is truly unused, including by tsdoc, the aliased type must be removed.

These rules are **mandatory** and follow the same enforcement expectations as the testing and C++ compatibility rules above: do not merge changes that leave examples or README snippets broken.
